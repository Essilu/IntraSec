# 👋 Welcome to our MasteCamp 2023 Student Project - Intrasec the Intranet with RBAC

Hello and welcome to our GitHub repository! This project is a collaborative effort by our team of five students: Elliot, Ulysse, Clément, Audrey, and Esteban. We are currently pursuing our studies in cybersecurity at EFREI, and our goal is to develop an intranet application with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) capabilities.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The main objective of our project is to build an intranet platform that incorporates RBAC functionality. RBAC allows for efficient and secure administration and management of user roles within the system. We aim to provide a comprehensive solution that meets the requirements of organizations in terms of access control and user management.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

To achieve our goal, we are utilizing the following technologies and frameworks:

- **ReactJS**: We have chosen ReactJS as our front-end framework for building a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Vite**: Vite is our build tool, providing fast and efficient development and bundling capabilities.
- **PostgreSQL**: PostgreSQL serves as our relational database management system, ensuring secure storage and retrieval of data.
- **Express.js**: Express.js is our choice for a back-end web application framework, enabling us to build robust and scalable server-side components.
- **Prisma**: Prisma is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that simplifies database access and management by providing a type-safe and auto-generated query API.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with our project, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command: `git clone (https://github.com/Essilu/IntraSec/)`
2. Install the project dependencies by navigating to the project directory and running the following command: `npm install`
3. Set up the database by configuring the PostgreSQL connection in the .env file and running the necessary migrations using Prisma.
4. Launch the development server by running the following command: `npm run dev` in both frontend and backend directories. 
5. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:PORT` and explore the features of our intranet with RBAC!
